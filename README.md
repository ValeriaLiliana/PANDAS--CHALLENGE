# PANDAS--CHALLENGE


Summary of Analysis:

In addressing the challenge at hand, the goal was to perform diverse calculations to support strategic decisions on future school budgets and priorities for the school board and mayor. Key trends emerged, particularly the similarity in scores and passing rates between small (<1000 students) and medium (1000-2000 students) schools. Notably, schools with 2000 students or fewer showcased superior average performances in math, reading, and overall passing rates. A noteworthy trend highlighted the dominance of charter schools in the top five spots for overall passing percentage, while district schools occupied the bottom five. This indicates that charter schools generally have higher passing percentages compared to district schools. The allocation of the district's budget, exceeding $24 million, presented an interesting dynamic where some of the highest-performing schools received lower budget allocations. In summary, smaller charter schools emerged as top performers within the district, while larger district schools tended to rank lower, with minimal score variation between grade levels.
